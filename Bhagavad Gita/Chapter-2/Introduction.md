#### Verse 58

> 
> **"yada samharate cayam   kurmo 'nganiva sarvasah**  
> **indriyanindriyarthebhyas   tasya prajna pratisthita"**


**Sthita Prajna**
 what is the definition of one whose mind is steady and one-pointed? How does he sit, walk, what does he do? Then Krishna tells him, just as a tortoise withdraws his limbs inside the shell and nothing hurts him, one who possesses sthita prajna (stabilized consciousness) withdraws all his senses and the thoughts don’t hurt him. He does get worries and anxiety, but he is not affected by them.

I have to control my 5 senses (touch, sight, hearing, smell and taste) and the sense center(mind) inorder to awaken the 6 sense. One cannot sense the above senses if his sense center is not focused. You might have realised many times when someone speaks to you when your focused on something(e.g) watching a movie. Eventhough your ears is out there it is not picking what the person is spoke to you it is because the sense center is focused in the movie. 

#### How to master your senses?
1) ***First be in the sense enjoyment fully*.**  when ever your doing something what ever senses applicable to the action employ them fully.
 Bring the 5 senses and the mind under the awareness to fully participate.
(e.g) when your eating  touch it, smell it and chew it fully and enjoy the eating.
2) ***Experience fully*** Even drinking tea forget about everything and sip it slowly and enjoy the pleasure of tea. spend 5mins
3) ***Area of weakness*** where ever there is a area of weakness you need to withdraw from those senses and practice sadhana.

vishayaga means information. Any information which is not processed and not used. Its useless. 
A person who has goals he only like to gather those information he will discard other informations. Successful people only spend 10% to get to know what is happening around him. 
They set a time for it outside of it he won't spend time on those things.  
On what bases should I create the filter?
  create filters inline to the goal 
On what bases should I filter?
There are three types of informations
1) Irrelevant information (useless info) they are rajashikh like amiruth but later turn in to position
2) Negative causing information (gossips, willingly hearing neagtive thins) 
3) Positive causing information (Initially it would be like a poision, but later it will give happiness)

**Sadhana**: Filter irrelvant and negative information.  see what kind of inout are you taking willingly ?
When you contact sense organ without wisdom it will lead to indulgence(It will take all energy).
when you withdraw without wisdom, and sadhana it will lead to suppression.

How to know the symptoms of indulgence? It will not allow you to focus. You can't even able to stick to a converstation for few minutes.
How to know the symptoms of suppression? Leads to anger, you will start to judge others.

#### Verse 59
>***viṣhayā vinivartante nirāhārasya dehinaḥ  
rasa-varjaṁ raso ’pyasya paraṁ dṛiṣhṭvā nivartate***

The objects of sense turn away from an abstinent person but not the relish. The relish also disappears having seen the highest.

The one whos appplying the demad and supply all the inputs of the life
1. where ever the input is not going to cause negative he allows it to mingle and enjoy.
2.  Where ever a particular input is completely is very very dangerous for him where he will completely loose control.there he will put a stop and let me build inerstrength 
3.  He also know the breakingpoint up to what point he is positive and after which point it goes negative.



**The nature will support you, if your intensity is strong on achieving a goal. 
The intensity of nature turning towards you  is propotional to your sincerity.**

The curicumstance or environment is not creating anything(reaction) within you. If you want to be strong you have to get out of that third process. 

The external circumstance is just bringing out what is within you, it is not the cause, but its only a trigger.

That person is irritating me. 
That person is behaving like that. I'm reacting.

**Sadhana:**  "When ever your effected by anything immedetiatley split the experience in to two. One is the triggering factor outside, and other is the reaction with in you. "

The whole idea is to increase the awareness.

Certain type of input right from the word go you loose control. There you have to be very careful. In many other instance up to a point you will allow yourself, but after that you will shutdown. 
You should follow the absenance (withdraw from sense) like a tortoise withdrawing its limb.  
How do I know the distance or point ? Its a lifetime tapase. A master do a fasting in one day, another day do a feast. Don't go by his action go by his principle.

Undertand the principle you are able to say NO when ever you loose control, by doing daily Sadhana. 
A successful person is one who keeps on getting up. But a person failed is not willing to get up. Learn and understand what is the breaking point as you do sadhana you will understand your breaking point.  

_**nirāhārasya**_ not having food
_**dehinaḥ**_ one who occupied the body
